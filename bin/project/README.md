**ML-SI** stands for "Machine Learnt Spectral Identification".

It is a library used to program a learning algorithm from MSI Databases and meant to be used on the MSI Website. It also features a couple
exemples of said algorithm to see how it works.

Main program will be added when the library is ready for use.
